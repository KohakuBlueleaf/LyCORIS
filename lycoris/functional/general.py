    return a tuple of two value of input dimension decomposed by the number closest to factor
    second value is higher or equal than first value.

    In LoRA with Kroneckor Product, first value is a value for weight scale.
    second value is a value for weight.

    Because of non-commutative property, A⊗B ≠ B⊗A. Meaning of two matrices is slightly different.
