# Change Log

## 2024/12/09 update to 3.1.1

#### New Features

* use `wd_on_output=True` can enable "correct" weight-decomposition implementation which use the output dimension of weight to calc the norm. The original implementation in LyCORIS calculate things on input dimension due to ambiguos annotation in paper.

#### Improvements

* BOFT now have more efficient implementation which avoid einops.rearrange.
* `.merge_to()` will automatically match the device and dtype now.

#### Bug fixes

* `scale_weight_norm` working correctly now.

## 2024/06/29 update to 3.0.0 - Brand New Functional API, Parametrize API and Module API

### The reasons of 3.0.0

We reconstruct the whole library with new Class definition and brand new Functional API system.

We also removed lot of redundant/unused modules.

Since the whole library are changed significantly. We decide to call it 3.0.0 as a new major version.

### Major Changes

* New Module API
* Add Parametrize API
* Add Functional API
  * LoCon/LoHa/LoKr/Diag-OFT/BOFT only.
* Remove optional deps from install_requires
* Remove lot of redundant/deprecated modules
* Better testing
* HunYuan DiT Support ([PR](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/1378) in kohya-ss/sd-scripts)

### Full change log

#### New Features

* LyCORIS now have consistent API for different algorithm like `bypass_forward_diff` or `get_diff_weight` method. Developers of other project can utilize these API to do more tricks or integrate LyCORIS into their framework more easily.
* LyCORIS now have parametrize API which utilize `torch.nn.utils.parametrize.register_parametrization` to directly patch individual parameters. Which can be useful for MHA layer or other tricky modules.
  * Currently only support 2~5D tensors. And LyCORIS will pretend these weights are weight of Linear/Conv1,2,3D then send it into LyCORIS modules
  * More native implementation or more detailed control will be added in the future.
* LyCORIS now have functional API. Developers who prefer functional more than Module things can utilize this feature.
  * Functional API also allow developers who don't want to introduce new dependencies. Just copy-paste the source code and utilizing it. (with Apache-2 License, directly copy-paste is totally allowed)
* Add support for Conv1d and Conv3d module on LoCon/LoHa/LoKr/Full/OFT/BOFT/GLoRA (not All algo in LyCORIS support them, you may receive error when apply unsopported algo), support inherited module (for example: `LoRACompatibleConv` or `LoRACompatibleLinear` from [`huggingface/diffusers`](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/models/lora.py))
* HunYuan DiT support.

#### Improvements, Fixes, Slight Changes

* Drop dependencies related to kohya-ss/sd-scripts:
  * We now take kohya-ss/sd-scripts as optional dependency
  * Which means `transformers`, `diffusers` and anything related to kohya are all optional deps now.
* The definition of dropout and rank_dropout in each algorithm are changed. Since some concept of original rank_dropout in the lora of kohya-ss/sd-script is hard to applied to other algorithm. We can only design the dropout for each module seperatedly.
* `apply_max_norm` issue are all fixed.
* DyLoRA, (IA)^3, GLoRA are all rewritten and support Linear/Conv1,2,3d.
* (IA)^3, GLoRA, Diag-OFT, BOFT are supported in `create_lycoris_from_weights`
  * `lycoris.kohya.create_network_from_weights` also support them as well.
* Fix wrong implementation of BOFT.
* `create_lycoris_from_weights` and `create_network_from_weights` now have correct logging infos.
* `get_module` and `make_module` are moved into modules' API.

#### Deprecation

* HCP modules are dropped. We will wait until HCP have better wrapper API.
* HyperNetwork-related modules like `hypernet/`, `attention.py`, `lilora.py` are removed.
* Uncompleted GLoKr are removed.
* code copied from kohya-ss/sd-scripts are removed. The original sd-scripts repo is now an optional dependency.

## 2024/03/15 update to 2.2.0 - QLyCORIS and DoRA

#### New Algo

* DoRA
  * Ref: [DoRA: Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation](https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/LyCORIS)
* Weight decompose for LoHa and LoKr. (A.K.A DoHa/DoKr)
  * DoRA/DoHa/DoKr will require smaller Learning rate!

#### New Features

* Support "bypass" (a.k.a. adapter) mode for LoHa/LoKr/OFT/BOFT
  * LoHa will require 2xFLOPs since we rebuild full diff weight and then do one more forward.
  * LoKr, OFT, BOFT should be more efficient than LoHa in bypass mode.
* Support [bnb 8bit/4bit Linear layer](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes) (a.k.a. QLyCORIS) with LoHa/LoKr/OFT/BOFT.
  * This will force module to enable bypass mode.

#### Fixes, slight changes

* Refine some details about code quality. Based on the report from GitRoll. (Thx you gitroll!)
* Remove redundant calculation in BOFT
* rank_dropout has been removed from OFT/BOFT temporarily untill we ensure how to apply it.
* Fix bugs in lokr when `lokr_w1_a` not exist.
* Fix bugs in conversion scritps.

* Fix bugs in scaled weight norms of OFT.
* Fix bugs in extract scripts for SDXL.

## 2023/12/02 update to 2.0.0

* Start supporting [HCP-Diffusion](https://github.com/IrisRainbowNeko/HCP-Diffusion) (The reason to name this version "2.0.0")
  * Now LyCORIS support LoHa/LoKr/Diag-OFT algorithm in HCP-Diffusion
  * Add Pivotal tuning utilities
  * Add hcp convert utilities
  * Have no plan at this time to support full/lora and train_norms since HCP can do them natively
